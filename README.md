## QA ENGINEER ACTIVITIES FOR REVIEWS SMART CONTRACTS AT [THE BLOCK TEMPLE](https://www.theblocktemple.com/) - (Work In Progress)

The aim of this project is to create a trustless, blockchain-based review platform that enables authentic customer feedback, secured through Polygon network using smart contracts ensuring transparent and indelible reviews for enhanced credibility. Also creating a concept that uses Bitcoin network in conjunction with the previous project by creating Merkle-Trees and transacting its roots to the Bitcoin network without wasting block space. Aiming to expose in the Startup Pitch Contest at [BTC Prague](https://www.btcprague.com/) 2023.

#### Technologies
1. **Languages:** Solidity, Javascript.
2. **Libraries:** Hardhat, Ethers.
3. **Others:**
    1. **Remix:** as an extra IDE for Solidity.

## RECOVERY OF FUNDS FROM COMPROMISED WALLETS - (2023)
Design and development of a sweeper-fighter bot to recover funds and ERC20 tokens from target wallets during the Arbitrum’s airdrop event. This software is able to fight in other blockchains like Polygon. Differences lie in each blockchain’s characteristics, such as mempool and gases managing.

#### Technologies
1. **Languages:** Python, Solidity.
2. **Libraries:** Web3.py.
3. **Others:**
    1. **Scanner:** both ArbiScan and PolygonScan were used to analyse important features and functioning of each smart contract’s code.
